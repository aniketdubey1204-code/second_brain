# 💰 Phase 4: Profit Strategy & Programs

Don't just hunt everywhere. Hunt where the money is and where others aren't looking.

### 1. Where to hunt?
- **HackerOne:** The biggest platform.
- **Bugcrowd:** Great for beginners.
- **Intigriti:** European focused, very professional.

### 2. Choosing a Program
- **VDP (Vulnerability Disclosure Program):** No money, but great for Hall of Fame and points (Good for starting).
- **BBP (Bug Bounty Program):** Cold hard cash. 💵
- **Public vs Private:** Private programs have less competition. Earn points in Public to get invited to Private.

### 3. The "Kabir" Strategy for Profit
1. **Pick a Niche:** Don't try to learn everything. Master **IDOR** or **Business Logic** first.
2. **Go Deep, Not Wide:** Instead of scanning 1000 websites, pick 1 and spend 3 days testing every button and feature.
3. **Automate the Boring Stuff:** Use scripts for Recon so you can spend your time on manual testing.
