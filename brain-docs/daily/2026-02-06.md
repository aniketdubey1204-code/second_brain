## Summary
Today was a major milestone: we built and deployed Aniket's "Second Brain." This Next.js application acts as a high-performance document viewer for our shared knowledge. Later, we underwent a massive UI overhaul to achieve a futuristic "iOS 26 Liquid Glass" aesthetic.

## Major Achievements
- **App Built**: Created a Next.js app with a sleek, dark theme.
- **Glass Overhaul**: Implemented animated liquid background blobs and frosted glass components.
- **Obsidian Integration**: Documents are stored as standard Markdown in `brain-docs/`.
- **Cloud Hosting**: Deployed to Vercel ([secondbrainn-ivory.vercel.app](https://secondbrainn-ivory.vercel.app/)).
- **Auto-Sync**: Established a Git-based workflow for live updates.

## Technical Details (UI Upgrade)
- **Liquid Background**: Animated CSS blobs with radial gradients floating behind content.
- **Glassmorphism**: Replaced solid backgrounds with `bg-white/5` + `backdrop-blur-xl`.
- **Global Stacking Fix**: Set body to transparent to allow background layers to shine through correctly.
- **Settings Page**: Built a functional glass-styled settings interface.

## WhatsApp & Privacy
- **Privacy Policy**: Updated logic to NEVER mention technical projects or personal discussions (e.g., website building) in auto-replies.
- **Family Protocols**: Strictly enforced respectful tone for family contacts.

## Technical Fixes
- **Next.js 16**: Fixed `params` awaiting issue and `setIsOpen` state variable mismatch in portfolio.
- **Tailwind 4**: Configured `@theme` and `@reference` for v4 compatibility.

## Decisions
- **One Journal per Day**: All updates for a single day must be merged into `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- **Naming Protocol**: Future files will follow the strict `YYYY-MM-DD.md` format without extra suffixes.
