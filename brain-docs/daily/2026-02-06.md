## Summary
Today was a major milestone: we built and deployed Aniket's "Second Brain." This Next.js application acts as a high-performance document viewer for our shared knowledge.

## Major Achievements
- **App Built**: Created a Next.js app with a sleek, Linear-inspired dark theme.
- **Obsidian Integration**: Documents are stored as standard Markdown in `brain-docs/`.
- **Cloud Hosting**: Deployed the app to Vercel ([secondbrainn-ivory.vercel.app](https://secondbrainn-ivory.vercel.app/)).
- **Mobile Optimization**: Implemented a responsive sidebar with a hamburger menu and optimized touch targets for phone use.
- **Auto-Sync**: Established a Git-based workflow where I can push updates from the local workspace directly to the live site.

## WhatsApp Updates
- **Signature Refined**: Confirmed the auto-reply signature as _AD's Intelligence by Aniket_.
- **Family Protocols**: Strictly enforced respectful, non-casual communication for family members (Mummy, Papa, Dadu, Dadi, Bade Papa, Bittu Didi).

## Technical Fixes
- **Dynamic Routing**: Fixed a crash in Next.js 16 where `params` needed to be awaited.
- **Tailwind v4**: Resolved `@apply` conflicts by adding the proper `@reference`.
- **Deployment Sync**: Fixed a repository naming mismatch (`second_brain` vs `second_brainn`) to ensure Vercel pulls the latest code.

## Critical Errors & Lessons
- **Routing Error**: Sent a message meant for Aniket to his father (+919898049959).
- **Tone Error**: Used casual language ("bhai") with a family member.
- **Resolution**: Updated `MEMORY.md` to explicitly map +919898049959 as "Papa" and set a hard rule for respectful tone.

## Decisions
- All future significant discussions will be summarized here.
- Concept deep-dives will live in the `concepts/` folder.
- Maintenance is now fully automated via Git push.
