## Summary
Early morning session focused on performance optimization and security implementation for the Second Brain.

## Major Achievements
- **Google Authentication**: Implemented NextAuth.js with Google Provider. Restricted access specifically to `aniketdubey1204@gmail.com`.
- **Performance Optimization**: 
    - Reduced background blob count from 4 to 2.
    - Optimized blur radius and added hardware acceleration (`will-change`).
    - Fixed significant lag issues reported by the user.
- **Middleware Security**: Configured Next.js 16 compatible middleware to protect all routes (except login and assets).

## Technical Fixes
- **Next.js 16 Middleware**: Fixed a critical build error where Vercel/Next.js 16 required an explicit function export for middleware instead of the standard object-based withAuth wrapper.
- **Chrome Cleanup**: Conducted a deep clean of Chrome's local cache and AI model storage, recovering over 6GB of space.

## Status
- Website: **Live & Secure**
- Performance: **Optimized**
- Storage: **~19GB Free on C drive**
