Project "The Dream Mirror" has been initiated and separated into a standalone local environment.

## 🚀 Key Achievements

### 1. The Dream Mirror (Project Initiation & Standalone)
- **Standalone Architecture**: Initialized a fresh Next.js environment for "The Dream Mirror" separate from the main Second Brain (`D:\Clawd Bot\workspace\dream-mirror`).
- **Subconscious Interface**: Developed a mystical, purple-themed UI dedicated to dream capture and neural visualization.
- **Neural Voice Interface**: Integrated microphone support for vocal dream recording with a visual timer and pulsing animation. 🎙️
- **Hindi/Hinglish Support**: Enabled Hindi language processing for dream descriptions and psychological analysis. 🇮🇳
- **Branch Deployment**: Pushed the standalone project to a new GitHub branch `dream-mirror` for secure HTTPS deployment (required for mic access).

### 2. Second Brain Alignment
- **Node Decoupling**: Removed integrated Dream Mirror components from the primary Second Brain to maintain structural integrity.
- **Persistence Fix**: Ensured `localStorage` logic remains stable for main system settings.

*Status: Vocal protocols active. HTTPS migration pending deployment.*
