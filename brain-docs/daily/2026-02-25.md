Today was a massive overhaul day for the **Second Brain** and system infrastructure. We transitioned from basic documentation to a fully functional **Cyberpunk Neural Interface**.

## 🚀 Key Achievements

### 1. Second Brain UI/UX Overhaul (v3.0)
- **Revamped Dashboard**: Implemented a "Cyberpunk Neural Interface" aesthetic with glowing effects, dynamic stats bars, and high-tech typography.
- **Side-by-Side Layout**: Fixed the overlapping sidebar issue. Now the sidebar and content area flow naturally together on laptops.
- **Dynamic Themes**: Added 3 functional themes: **Cyber Dark**, **Liquid Glass**, and **Neon Pulse**.
- **Neural Density**: Implemented font size controls (Small, Medium, Large) that persist across sessions.
- **Settings Persistence**: Integrated `localStorage` so all user preferences survive page refreshes.
- **Functional Search**: Dashboard search now filters document nodes in real-time.
- **Logout Protocol**: Added a "Disconnect" feature in the sidebar with user profile synchronization.

### 2. Bug Bounty HQ 🛡️
- **New Section**: Launched a dedicated Offensive Security repository.
- **Hacker Roadmap**: Added a comprehensive "Scratch to Professional" study guide.
- **Resources Database**: Curated essential tools, books, labs, and YouTube channels for security research.
- **Offensive UI**: Designed a specific Red/Dark high-contrast theme for this section.

### 3. Model & Infrastructure Optimization
- **Infinite Gemini Mode**: Authenticated 5 unique Google IDs to enable automatic **Auth Rotation**. The system now switches profiles automatically when quotas hit 429 limits.
- **Coding Specialist**: Configured a `coding` alias to automatically use **Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking)** or **Claude 4.5 Opus** for development tasks.
- **Automatic Fallbacks**: Set up a robust fallback chain: `Gemini 3 Flash` -> `Gemini 3 Pro (High)` -> `Claude Sonnet` -> `Claude Opus`.

### 4. System Maintenance
- **Storage Optimization**: Performed a deep cleanup of User Temp directories to free up space on the C: drive.
- **Git Synchronization**: Successfully managed multiple remote repositories and forced alignment between `second_brain` and `second_brainn`.
