# February 6, 2026 - The Glass Overhaul

Today was a big day for the Second Brain UI. Aniket wanted something "futuristic" and "colorful," specifically mentioning an **iOS 26 liquid glass** vibe.

## Key Improvements
1. **Liquid Background**: Implemented animated blobs using CSS keyframes and radial gradients. These float behind the content, creating a dynamic, neural feel.
2. **Glassmorphism**: 
    - Moved away from solid `#0D0D0D` backgrounds.
    - Used `bg-white/5` with `backdrop-blur-xl` and subtle borders.
    - Added blue/pink glows on hover for different categories.
3. **Global Stacking Fix**: Resolved a tricky issue where the body's background was covering the fixed background layer. Setting the body to transparent and managing z-indexes fixed it.
4. **Settings Page**: Initialized a dedicated settings interface with a modern glass look.

## Technical Notes
- **Framer Motion**: Used for staggered entry animations on the dashboard.
- **Tailwind 4**: Utilized the new `@theme` and direct CSS imports.
- **Deployment**: Pushed updates to `second_brainn.git`.

The brain feels much more "alive" now.
