# Bug Bounty: From Scratch to Professional 🛡️

Welcome to the definitive offensive security roadmap. This guide tracks your progress from a beginner to a high-earning security researcher.

## 🟢 Phase 1: Foundations (The Basics)
- [ ] **Networking Fundamentals**: IP, TCP/UDP, DNS, HTTP/S protocols.
- [ ] **Web Technologies**: HTML, JS, Web Servers (Nginx/Apache), Databases (SQL/NoSQL).
- [ ] **Linux Command Line**: Mastering the terminal, grep, find, sed, awk.
- [ ] **The "Hacker Mindset"**: Understanding how systems break.

## 🟡 Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis (The "Bread & Butter")
- [ ] **OWASP Top 10**: Deep dive into the most critical web risks.
- [ ] **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Stored, Reflected, and DOM-based.
- [ ] **SQL Injection**: Union-based, Error-based, Blind SQLi.
- [ ] **Broken Access Control**: IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference).
- [ ] **CSRF**: Cross-Site Request Forgery.
- [ ] **SSRF**: Server-Side Request Forgery.

## 🟠 Phase 3: Reconnaissance & Automation (Scaling Up)
- [ ] **Passive Recon**: Subdomain enumeration, Shodan, Google Dorking.
- [ ] **Active Recon**: Port scanning (Nmap), Fuzzing (ffuf/dirsearch).
- [ ] **Automation**: Writing Bash/Python scripts to chain tools together.
- [ ] **Frameworks**: Using Burp Suite Professional like a pro.

## 🔴 Phase 4: Advanced Exploitation & Specialization
- [ ] **API Security**: Testing REST, GraphQL, and SOAP.
- [ ] **Cloud Security**: AWS/Azure/GCP misconfigurations (S3 buckets, IAM).
- [ ] **Mobile Hacking**: Android/iOS app security.
- [ ] **Logic Flaws**: Hunting for business logic errors that automated tools miss.

## 💎 Phase 5: Professional Workflow
- [ ] **Report Writing**: How to write clear, impactful POCs (Proof of Concepts).
- [ ] **Bounty Platforms**: HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti.
- [ ] **Negotiation**: How to handle triage and bounty discussions.
