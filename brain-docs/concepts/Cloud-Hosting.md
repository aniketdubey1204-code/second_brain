# Cloud Hosting & Sync

Our Second Brain is now live on the internet!

## Hosting Details
- **Platform**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- **Deployment URL**: [https://secondbrainn-ivory.vercel.app/](https://secondbrainn-ivory.vercel.app/)
- **Repository**: [aniketdubey1204-code/second_brain](https://github.com/aniketdubey1204-code/second_brain)

## How Syncing Works
1. I (the AI) create or edit a file in the local `second-brain/brain-docs/` folder on Aniket's laptop.
2. I then perform a Git commit and Push to the GitHub repository.
3. Vercel detects the new push on the `main` branch.
4. It automatically rebuilds the site and deploys the updates.

This ensures that the "Brain" is always accessible from Aniket's phone without needing the laptop to be running a local server.
