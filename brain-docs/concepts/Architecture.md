# Obsidian-Linear Architecture

The Second Brain app is designed with a hybrid aesthetic:

## Obsidian Inspiration
- **Markdown Core**: All documents are stored as simple `.md` files for maximum portability.
- **Bi-directional Linking**: (Planned) Using standard `[[Link]]` syntax to connect ideas.
- **Local First**: Files live on your disk, not in a proprietary cloud.

## Linear Inspiration
- **Sleek UI**: A monochromatic dark theme with subtle borders and high-contrast typography.
- **Fast Navigation**: A sidebar that allows quick switching between journals, concepts, and all docs.
- **Focused Experience**: No clutter, just the content you need.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js**: For a fast, responsive web interface.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: For modern, utility-first styling.
- **Lucide React**: For consistent, clean iconography.
- **Gray Matter**: For parsing metadata from documents.
